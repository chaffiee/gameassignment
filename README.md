homework

Unfortunetly, this assignment didn't work out as i hoped so.
partly beacause i thought we had the weekend to work on this, and did not see the deadline for saturday.
the other part because we had worked on dom the past week and the javascript basics. This assignment had staps which worked with mocha
and the code was not recogniseable for me at all. so i havent been able to work out the rest of the assignment.
